= 3Scale API with OIDC

This is a tutorial about how to correctly setup the integration between 3Scale API Management and Red Hat Single Sign On (Keycloak), 
to work with APIs using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

* Tested version: 3Scale 2.8
* Official doc: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.8/html-single/administering_the_api_gateway/index#configure-oidc-rhsso-integration

. Create a tenant (realm) on Red Hat Single Sign On

. Set the following variables in your terminal, 

It will help the next commands more readable.

    SSO_HOST=sso-sso.apps.ramalho-aa51.open.redhat.com
    SSO_REALM=redhat
    CERT=cert.pem

Setup Zync and RHSSO Communication

A lot of times clusters are using self signed certs, so you need to make the Zync-que component of 3Scale trust on the cert from RHSSO. 

. Get the RHSSO cert

    echo | openssl s_client -connect $SSO_HOST:443 -servername $SSO_HOST -showcerts 2>&1 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > $CERT

If you do a `ls` you will show that a cert.pem was created from the previous command. 

. Test to show if it's working. 

    curl -v https://$SSO_HOST/auth/realms/$REALM --cacert $CERT

The output should be a JSON, like this: 

    {"realm":"redhat","public_key":"MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAp5k3kKzOa6Kj4WDoVhw6v/rhN5ti0uwNCbenpYZlkNoj+m+xlSZZCavdYpScibZmwsIb2p8EUi/h0codf/EAdq/LJ4Dq4uUZMMWauXymEF15PUgu05WHDd6Q2zZFbFtHcrnccmrhIAt0iuTX/+EOsbbmp85LJOVskpTve4RFkBICo8If3tP64IVh+OPr7BW7zPNj81sobLgvzJYg6Ic1LWRPb+WpTBYqSHPs9Y6etlOE+qibKH5hwaI/4L6MaVdJ5yZpUNREJZ6Y997xmTbzdiW6w0IK5w+OF/CiI+P5KcWK8oCDsyNUn1jEwMIky+YUwWgdQNQUZhhBO+BNRkDD0wIDAQAB","token-service":"https://sso-sso.apps.ramalho-aa51.open.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat/protocol/openid-connect","account-service":"https://sso-sso.apps.ramalho-aa51.open.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat/account","tokens-not-before":0}* Closing connection 0

. Create a 3scale client, this client will be the responsable for create the clients in RHSSO delegated by 3Scale.

Just take note of this credentials, we will need it later:

    Client ID: 3scale-admin 
    Secret: ...

. Also create a *user*, could be any user, we will use it to test the integration

image::create-user-02.png[Create a user]

. On 3Scale select Configuration into the API side menu

. Select the option *OpenID Connect Use OpenID Connect for any Oauth2 flow.* under *AUTHENTICATION* session.

. On the field *OpenID Connect Issuer*

You will use the credentials generated before in the following format: 

    https://<CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET>@<RHSSO_HOST>:<RHSSO_PORT>/auth/realms/<REALM_NAME>

So the result in my curently example is:

    https://3scale-admin:939bb4b6-3704-485f-8c7d-d07cd23fb13f@sso-sso.apps.ramalho-aa51.open.redhat.com:443/auth/realms/redhat
